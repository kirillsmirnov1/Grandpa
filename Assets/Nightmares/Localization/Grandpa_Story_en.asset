      find its footing.  I fall down, flying down a well of soviet wallpaper, book
      shelves, and tiled floors. A Czechoslovakian set flies past me, my grandpa's
      favorite chair, those stupid spiders, the carpet, and my grandpa's damn dentures,
      which seem to be trying to bite me.\n\nI fall, hitting shelves, corners, walls.
      My bare foot catches a square of bathroom tile flying by. Blood flies up, I
      fly down. Things keep popping out of the darkness and into it. \n        \nI
      keep falling and falling until the darkness below parts and I spot him, Grandpa.
      He's in a wheelchair, the same wheelchair he was so ashamed of. Right now,
      he's angry, he's furious, but he's powerless. His body is covered with flies.
      And then, his eye, the one that's not covered in blood from his fractured skull,
      spots me. He throws his cane at me, but misses - the stick hits the wall.\n\nAnd
      I continue to fall, I get closer to him, but he remains as tiny as if I were
      looking at him from afar. Or is it me who's getting bigger? And so, I fall
      right on top of him, crushing his skull with my foot, breaking old bones that
      crunch quietly, but there's his groan.... Mixed with the sound of the alarm
      clock, and I'm not a little boy anymore, and I'm back in my bed, and the nightmare
      is over."

      There she was - smiling, always happy about something of her own; and before
      we knew it, the disease had taken her away. Grandma and grandpa lived together
      for half a century, their whole life, but not all of it. The rest was left
      for grandpa to live on his own. \n\nI was a little kid then, knee-high to a
      grasshopper, I had just started the second grade. I felt very sorry for my
      grandpa, so I started going to his apartment more often, listening to him.
      Grandpa had a lot of stories to tell. \n\nHe loved to talk about his apiary.
      About the delicious honey he made. How he loved his bees and how they responded
      by thanking him with honey. Now he had no energy for his bees. His friend,
      who was younger, took over everything. Grandpa sometimes went to help him,
      and always brought back honey in honeycomb, in a wooden frame, the most delicious
      honey I had ever tasted in my life."

      even on the contrary, they help, they catch flies. \r\n\r\nGranny, while she
      was alive, though she grumbled, took them out, letting them run away to their
      spider affairs far away from here. Then she'd sweep up the cobwebs with a broom.
      And without grandma, no one touched the spiders or the cobwebs - who wants
      to upset grandpa once again? \r\n\r\nGrandma left, the spiders came."

      teeth, even artificial ones, his speech became worse, more unintelligible.\n\nAnd
      his dentures were still on the windowsill. At one point I caught it with my
      elbow while I was sitting at the table, and it fell on me, right on my leg.
      I thought it was going to bite me. I could hardly hold back tears of fear,

      the serpent's eyes were painted red. I never understood why there was a snake
      on the stick, as if it were a witch's stick. But who knows what that village

      with the glitter of its red snake-red oily eyes. I always tried to watch this
      snake with the corner of my eye, in case it would crawl away, who knows what

      was some fire burning inside him, he wanted to trample the ground with his
      feet, but without a stick he could not."

      had been together all their lives, hand in hand. But their pity was sometimes
      a little stale. I once heard from my aunt: \"I wish grandpa would go away soon,
      instead of suffering here alone.\" Those words made me squeeze inside. Here
      he is, grandpa, holding up well, he goes to his friend's apiary by himself,
      he brings you fresh honey, and you wish him to die. I didn't know what she
      was talking about at first. I didn't understand until the end.\n\nWith me,
      Grandpa tried to be cheerful. He smiled at me and told me stories. Grandma
      used to grow mint on the windowsill, so grandpa took over this apartment gardening.
      He always treated me to mint. He said it was good for me. \n\nWhen my father,
      his son, came to visit, the two of them couldn't have enough fun for a teaspoon.
      I kept pestering - \"Grandpa, Grandpa, tell me more.\" Grandpa put on a smile,
      took his worn wallet from the window sill and poured me some coins. \"Go buy
      yourself some ice cream and run around with the boys\" \u2014 I read in my
      father's eyes. While I was leaving, my father and grandfather sat silent. When
      I came back, they were silent too. They only sighed once in a while. Maybe
      they talked about something while I was away, but who would let me, a boy,
      into adult conversations?"

      the curtained windows onto the kitchen laminate, flowing lazily down the hallway,
      and not much of it reached me, just a few drops. Through the ajar bedroom door
      I could see the wheelchair, but it was empty. Where was Grandpa? I took a few
      steps down the hallway and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something
      twitching in the bathroom doorway. I had the strength to take a couple more
      steps forward, to look inside. I had to wait for my eyes to adjust to the darkness.
      \n\nFate had found Grandpa in an awkward position. His hand was still clutching
      the cane, but his head.. His face was staring into the cold tile of the bathroom.
      Under his head was a puddle of something dark and thick, spread out like grandma's
      jam. His greasy, disheveled hair was smeared, and his left hand was all red.
      And his right hand clutches the cane, jerking it back and forth - \"Don't come
      near, I'll hurt you\". The cane is going round and round, and the serpent is
      dancing on it, and his eyes are glimmering menacingly, and he is about to bite.
      Chills swept over me.\n\nAnd then... I froze, I couldn't move anymore.  I don't
      remember how long I stood there. My gaze was fixed and no force in the world
      could move it. Grandpa was squirming, letting out his last breaths. The light
      of his soul was fading in his eyes.\n\nThe barely perceptible flicker of red
      snake eyes on the stick. Watching, watching, laughing.\n\nI found my grandfather,
      and the adults found us. By then the old man was beyond saving. The rest of
      it... Next, everything flew by in a few frames, which my memory still refuses
      to connect. The family gathering. Sullen faces. No one makes eye contact. Pity. "

      the entryway. Snow flies in through the broken glass. I open the door with
      my parents' key. It opens with difficulty - no one has greased the hinges for
      a long time. \n\nThe apartment is dark. So dark that I can't see the floor,
      the walls, anything. Only the curtained window in the kitchen. I go in, I know
      this apartment, I can get through in the dark. Except my foot doesn't find
      a foothold. I fall down, into the void, into the cold. \n\nI fall for a long
      time. The barely discernible light from the kitchen guides my fall downward.
      My eyes adjust to the darkness and I see that there are such familiar objects
      around me. But there's something wrong with them. There's something wrong with
      them all...\n\nI fall until I see him - broken, mangled in pain, twitching
      his cane. His arms and legs have finally turned into spider's legs. He's not
      angry, no, he's scared, confused, he doesn't know what's happening. One last
      spasm, one last convulsion. His arms and legs grow spider hair and the blood
      on his face gathers into eight eyeballs. \n\nMy fall gets slower. Grandpa thrusts
      his spider legs toward me. I try to dodge, but I can't, he gets me after all.
      Blunt blows, as if through a thick puffy coat, it doesn't even hurt. I keep
      falling, and the lower I fall, the smaller Grandpa gets, until I land right
      on top of him and give him a final squeeze. \n\nI wake up to the crunch of
      the grandpa-spider under my feet. I breathe heavily, looking around until it
      comes to me that it was all a dream. This dream again."
