    m_Localized: "I enter my grandpa's place, take a step in, but my foot doesn't
      find its footing.  I fall down, flying down a well of soviet wallpaper, book
      shelves, and tiled floors. A Czechoslovakian set flies past me, my grandpa's
      favorite chair, those stupid spiders, the carpet, and my grandpa's damn dentures,
      which seem to be trying to bite me.\r\n\r\nI fall, hitting shelves, corners,
      walls. My bare foot catches a square of bathroom tile flying by. Blood flies
      up, I fly down. Things keep popping out of the darkness and into it. \r\n\t\r\nI
      keep falling and falling until the darkness below parts and I spot him, Grandpa.
      He's in a stroller, the same stroller he was so ashamed of. Right now, he's
      angry, he's furious, but he's powerless. His body is covered with flies. And
      then, his eye, the one that's not covered in blood from his fractured skull,
      spots me. He throws his cane at me, but misses - the stick hits the wall.\r\n\r\nAnd
      I continue to fall, I get closer to him, but he remains as tiny as if I were
      looking at him from afar. Or is it me who's getting bigger? And so, I fall
      right on top of him, crushing his skull with my foot, breaking old bones that
      crunch quietly, but there's his groan.... Mixed with the sound of the alarm
      clock, and I'm not a little boy anymore, and I'm back in my bed, and the nightmare
      is over."
